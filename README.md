## What is Giiv?
Giiv connects volunteers with local volunteer opportunities.  Organizations and
individuals can request volunteers.  Users can browse and commit to volunteer opportunities.

**Hypothesis**: We would give more of our time and help others in need more often if it was
easier to do.

### Problem
- We're afraid to ask for help because we don't want to 'put someone out' or
inconvenience them.
- Too many transactional relationships. We receive goods and services but are lonely.
- Volunteering is hard to do. Too onerous of a process to sign up to be a
volunteer somewhere, and it's difficult to find volunteers.
- It's hard to ask for help. Nobody wants to be a burden on someone else, and
  none of us know what other people have going on in their lives.
- It's hard to offer help. You don't want to presume that someone needs your
    help.

### Example Volunteer Opportunities
1. Sam, an 80 year-old neighbor needs help getting to and from the grocery store
   on Saturdays.
1. Christie is moving apartments and could use help from a few able-bodied people moving
   heavy furniture for an hour.
1. The Boulder Shambala Center is hosting a party to celebrate the changing
   seasons and needs 5 people to help run the raffle.
1. Chelsea, a single mother, needs help doing her taxes.
1. Poudre Valley High School needs 7 chaperones for an upcoming field trip.

It's hard to ask for help.
It's hard to offer help.
Giiv makes it easier.

## Development

MVP Stage 1: Craigslist for volunteer opportunities. Build a 'digital
bulletin board' for a church or community group. CRUD volunteer opportunities.

Stage 2: Commit (register) for volunteer opportunities. Request a certain
number of people... users can offer to help... accept help.

Stage 3 and beyond: Calendar integration. Location. Recommendations. Social
Media Features.

## Potential Features

### Calendar integration
- You indicate when you're available on a calendar, highlighting blocks of time
you're free to help someone in need. Giiv notifies you when there are
opportunities during your free time.
- When you 'commit' to a volunteer opportunity, it is
added to your personal calendar.

### Recommendations
- Location - what's in walking distance? driving distance? etc.
- Interests/causes listed in your profile people your friends have helped.
- Services you are willing/able to render

### Admin features ($)

## Revenue
- $1 per volunteer recruited through Giiv?  Hourly charge? $/person/hour?  Corporations could
- sponsor Giiv over certain periods of time. "All requests for help are free
today thanks to Coca Cola."
- Special admin features
- branded communities
- Promoted posts

## Managing Trust
- You have to say that you'd like to help, and the person or organization has to agree to accept the help.
- People have profiles.  Organizations can verify if people belong.
  When someone volunteers to help you, you can see what organizations they
  belong to and a history of what type of help they've provided in the past to
  others, making it easier to trust them.
- Giiv could help ease the paperwork burden for schools and similar
    organizations that require background checks or onerous applications.
  - perhaps Giiv could offer a common application form?
